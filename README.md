# Odin-Project-TodoList
The Todo List app is a web-based tool for organizing tasks across multiple projects. Users can create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities. Using constructors, modular JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, it provides a dynamic experience. Data is saved in localStorage for persistence, ensuring tasks remain available after refresh
